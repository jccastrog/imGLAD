What is imGLAD?
---------------
imGLAD is a computational tool for detection of bacterial genomes in metagenomic datasets. imGLAD has two steps fitting a model and predicting data. The fitting step simulates metagenomic datasets and randoly spikes them with the target genome. This is used to create a logistic model to discriminate positive samples from negative samples. The prediction step uses the model paramters to estimate the likelihood of presence of the target genome in a given metagenomic sample.
