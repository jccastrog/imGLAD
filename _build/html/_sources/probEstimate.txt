Probability estimation
======================
``probEstimate.py`` estimates the likelihood of presence of your target genome in a metagenomic sample (one or more).

Getting started
---------------
First you need to run ``fitModel.py`` and get the parameters file it generatesi (``parameters.txt``).

Before running ``probEstimate.py`` you should also run a Blastn or Blat of your metagenomic sample against the target genome you created the model with. The output should be stored in tabular format.

General options
---------------

Required arguments
__________________
-t TARGET       Subject sequences (ref) in FastA format.
-m MAP  One or more Tabular BLAST files of reads vs genes (or contigs).
-p PARAM        Parameters file obtained from fitModel.py

Single mode
-----------
The ``parameters.txt`` file will save parameters for a model based on sequencing breath only and a model based o sequeincing breadth and depth. Single mode will use sequencing breadth parameters to estimate the likelihood of presence.

Example 1
_________
``$>./probEstimate.py -t genome.fa -m blastTab_01.tbl -p parameters.txt -l single``

The above line will estimate the likelihood of presence of the target genome in the metagenomic sample, based on sequencing breadth, the results will be displayed in the screen like.

========== ================== ================ =======
Filename   Sequencing breadth Sequencing depth P-value
---------- ------------------ ---------------- -------
file01.tsv float              float            float
========== ================== ================ =======

You can save these results by redirecting the output to a file.

``$>./probEstimate.py -t genome.fa -m blastTab_01.tbl -p parameters.txt -l single  > results.tsv``

General mode
------------
``fitModel.py`` estimates parameters for the model based on sequencing depth as well. If general mode is used both variables will be used to calculate the precense probability.

Example 2
_________

``$>./probEstimate.py -t genome.fa -m blastTab_01.tbl -p parameters.txt -l general``

Will instruct ``probEstimate.py`` to include sequencing depth in the calculation of likelihood for presence.

**NOTE:** Using general mode can lead to false positive identification due to high mapping of conserved regions, plasmids, or mobile elements.
